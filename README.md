# Wallaroo

Welcome to Wallaroo. 

Currently everything that we want version for the project is stored in this monorepo. Why a monorepo? At the moment, we are regularly making changes cut across multiple sub-projects. It makes sense to keep them all together in a single monorepo at this time.

## Naming

All project names are pulled from characters from the TV show _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_. You don't have to have watched the show to work on the project, but you have to have watched in order to name anything. We jokingly take the naming seriously and try to name components after a character whose role on the show matches their role in this project.

## Important Document Highlights

The Wallaroo book source is available in the [book](book/) directory. Due to how GitBook works, a couple files for the book also exist in the top level of this repo: `Summary.md`, `intro.md`, and `cover.jpg`.

Before commiting any code, be sure to read the [contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md) documentation.

Check out the [build](BUILD.md) documentation for important information on how we stay up to date with the latest Pony compiler changes.

For information about using LLDB to debug Pony programs, please see the [Pony LLDB Cheatsheet](https://www.ponylang.org/reference/pony-lldb-cheatsheet/).

Additional documentation, including developer onboarding is in the [doc](doc/) directory.
