## What is Wallaroo?

Wallaroo is a framework for writing event-by-event distributed data processing applications. Weâ€™ve designed it to handle demanding high-throughput, low-latency tasks where accuracy of results is key. You can learn more about Wallaroo from our ["Hello Wallaroo!" blog post](https://blog.wallaroolabs.com/2017/03/hello-wallaroo/).

## About this Repo

Wallaroo currently exists as a monorepo. All the source that makes Wallaroo go is in this repo. Let's take a quick walk through what you'll find in each top-level directory:

- atkin

Source for runner application that powers our still prototype Python "Actor" API.

- book

Markdown source used to build [http://docs.wallaroolabs.com](http://docs.wallaroolabs.com). [http://docs.wallaroolabs.com](http://docs.wallaroolabs.com) gets built from the latest commit to the `release` branch. There's also ["Wallaroo-Latest" documentation](https://www.gitbook.com/book/wallaroo-labs/wallaroo-latest/details). "Wallaroo-Latest" is built from master so it will be as up to date as possible. Be aware many of the external links in our documentation point to the `release` branch. "Wallaroo-Latest" is intended only for the most adventurous amongst us.

- cpp_api

Code for writing Wallaroo applications using C++. This is currently unsupported.

- examples

Wallaroo example applications in a variety of langugages. Currently only the Python API examples are supported.

- giles

TCP utlity applications that can stream data over TCP to Wallaroo applications and receive TCP streams from said applications.
