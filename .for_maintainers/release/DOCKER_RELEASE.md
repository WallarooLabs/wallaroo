# Releasing the Wallaroo and Metrics UI Docker images for a release candidate or release branch

This document is aimed at members of the Wallaroo team who might be releasing the Wallaroo and Metrics UI Docker images for a release candidate or release branch. It serves as a checklist that can take your through the Docker image release process step-by-step.

To learn more about our release process, see [RELEASE.md].

## Prerequisites for releasing the Docker images

In order to release the Docker images, you absolutely must have:

* A Bintray account
* A Bintray API key with access to the `wallaroolabs` Docker repository
* Vagrant installed

## Releasing the Docker images

Please note that this document was written with the assumption that you are using a clone of the `wallaroolabs/wallaroo` repo. This process will not work without modification if you try to use a fork rather than a clone of the repo. The `docker-release.sh` script assumes you are using the `release` branch or a release candidate branch that follows the `release-*` format.

### Start up the Wallaroo Vagrant box

From the top level `wallaroo` directory run the following:

```bash
cd  .release
vagrant up
```

This command will bring up a vagrant box with Wallaroo's build and release dependencies installed and with the `wallaroo` repo cloned to `/users/ubuntu/wallaroo`.

### SSH into Wallaroo Vagrant box

From within the `.release` directory run:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

This will `ssh` you into the running Wallaroo box.

### Pull latest changes for your branch

From within the Wallaroo Vagrant box, you'll want to run a `git pull` for the branch you plan to use to release the Wallaroo and Metrics UI Docker images like so:

```bash
cd ~/wallaroo
git checkout origin/RELEASE_BRANCH
git pull
```

So if you were going to release the Docker images using `release-0.4.0`, you'd run the following:

```bash
cd ~/wallaroo
git checkout origin/release-0.4.0
git pull
```

### Log into Bintray's Docker repository

From within the Wallaroo Vagrant box, you'll want to log in to the Bintray Docker repository using the following command:

```bash
docker login -u <YOUR_USER> -p <API_KEY> wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io
```

Please note that you MUST be a member of the `wallaroo-labs/wallaroolabs` Bintray Docker repository in order to have publish access. If you need access, contact @seanTallen or @JONBRWN before continuing.

### Releasing the Wallaroo and Metrics UI images

From within the Wallaroo Vagrant box run the following:

```bash
cd /users/ubuntu/wallaroo
bash .release/docker-release.sh RELEASE_VERSION RELEASE_COMMIT
```

So, for example, if you are releasing version `0.4.0` from commit `8a8ee28` then your command would be:

```bash
bash .release/docker-release.sh 0.4.0 8a8ee28
```

This will then build and push the Wallaroo and Metrics UI images for the provided version and commit to Bintray. If using the `release` branch, images will be hosted under `wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io/release` and if using a `release-*` branch, images will be hosted under `wallaroo-labs-docker-wallaroolabs.bintray.io/dev`


### Stop the Wallaroo Vagrant Box

Once you've successfully built and pushed the Wallaroo and Metrics UI Docker images, you can stop the Wallaroo Vagrant box with the following command from within the `.release` directory on your local machine:

```bash
vagrant halt
```
