# Wallaro Terraform Orechestration - VPC module

This module consists of the orchestration for Wallaroo using Terraform for the VPC.
So far we have only implemented AWS as a provider.

## Module details

The VPC module handles creating the VPC along with the subnet, security group, etc. The state for this is stored in a shared S3 bucket. NOTE: This does *not* guarantee safety for multiple developers to work concurrently (see: https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/remote/).

The VPC module's state is used by the `cluster` module.

Files:

* `variables.tf` defines all the variables being used and their defaults
* `outputs.tf` defines all the output values we expose for use by modules that depends on this one
* `vpc.tf` defines all the resources being created using the variables for properties as appropriate

## Terraform Remote State

We're relying ton Terraform Remote State in order to store state in a centalized location.

The commands available are:

* `terraform remote pull` to refresh the local cache with remote state
* `terraform remote push` to sync the local cache with remote state
* `terraform remote config` to configure/change configuration for the remote state

Documentation can be found at: https://www.terraform.io/docs/commands/remote.html

NOTE: So far it doesn't seem like it is necessary to use the pull/push commands explicitly the majority of the time as Terraform seems to automagically do a pull/push as required (except when a `terraform show` command is used).
