* Preparations
** Disable Docker TLS
Follow these instructions to disable TLS encryption between your
docker host and the docker daemon running inside the VM.

* How to test Dagon Process
** Context
1. We are running the double-divice test
2. We only need native binaries. No containers.
3. We will run all components as local processes.
4. We don't need a Docker host.
5. We need to adapt the absolute paths in the docker-example.ini config file

** Build
1. Checkout buffy and switch to branch "dagon-docker-reanimator"
2. run "make"
4. cd dagon

** Configure
We're using the double-divide.ini file as is.

** Run
Start the test like this:
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dagon -t 10 --filepath=double-divide.ini --phone-home=10.23.108.131:8080
#+END_SRC

* How to test Dagon Docker

** Context
1. We are running the double-divide test
2. We need to build all components as Linux containers
3. We will run Dagon from the host system (OSX or Linux)
4. We need a running docker host
5. We need to adapt the absolute paths in the docker-example.ini config file

** Build
1. Checkout buffy and switch to branch "dagon-docker-reanimator"
2. run "make arch=amd64"
3. run "make arch=amd64 build-docker"
4. cd dagon
5. run "stable env ponyc --debug"

** Configure
1. create a docker network named "buffy" as a bridge network
2. edit the docker-example.ini file and update the following information to match your local system (this is just temporary)
#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
DOCKER_CERT_PATH
docker.dir
docker.userid
docker.tag
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Run
Start the test with the following command (run from the dagon sub directory):
#+BEGIN_SRC sh
./dagon --docker=<docker-host>:<port> -t 10 \
 --filepath=docker-example.ini \
 --phone-home=<dagon-host>:8080
#+END_SRC
