# Python API Introduction

The Wallaroo Python API can be used to write Wallaroo applications entirely in Python. This lets developers quickly get started with Wallaroo by leveraging their existing Python knowledge.

In order to write a Wallaroo application in Python, the developer creates classes that provide the methods expected by the API (see [Wallaroo Python API Classes](api.md) for more detail on this) and writes an entry point function that uses the Wallaroo ApplicationBuilder to define the layout of their application.

For a basic overview of what Wallaroo does, read [What is Wallaroo](/book/getting-started/what-is-wallaroo.md) and [Core Concepts](/book/core-concepts/intro.md). These documents will help you understand the system at a high level so that you can see how the pieces of the Python API fit into it.

To set up your environment for writing and running Wallaroo Python application, refer to [Building a Python Application](building.md).

To learn how to write your own application, refer to [Writing Your Own Application](writing-your-own-application.md).

To read about the structure and requirements of each API class, refer to [Wallaroo Python API Classes](api.md).

To read about the command-line arguments Wallaroo takes, refer to [Appendix: Wallaroo Command-Line Options](/book/appendix/wallaroo-command-line-options.md).
