# Choosing an Installation Option for Wallaroo

For 64-bit Linux users, we provide four different ways for you to install Wallaroo:
- [Wallaroo Up](/book/go/getting-started/wallaroo-up.md)
- [Installing from Source](/book/go/getting-started/linux-setup.md)

If you are unsure about which solution is right for you, a breakdown of each is provided below. (NOTE: Wallaroo does not support 32-bit platforms.)

## Wallaroo Up

We recommend this process if you would prefer to use your development environment and do not mind the additional system requirements necessary for Wallaroo to be installed and running on your machine. The Wallaroo Up script automatically takes care of installing everything for setting up a Wallaroo development environment.

This process requires installing several system libraries which may conflict with requirements of other tools in your development environment. We recommmend reviewing the process before proceeding.
