# What to Expect

For the remainder of the "Getting Started" section, we're going to start by getting your development environment setup and then compiling and running a Wallaroo application. By the time you are done with this, you will have touched many of the tools you'll use with Wallaroo as well has having run a Wallaroo application locally and shaken out any issues related to getting one setup.

From there, we'll dive into a review of core Wallaroo concepts that are important to understanding while designing and running Wallaroo applications. As much as possible, we will avoid being language specific. After our core concepts overview, we'll enter choose your own adventure land. 

This guide contains documentation for each of the languages that you can currently use to write Wallaroo applications. We suggest that you do the following:

1. Complete the "Getting Started" guide which will get your a workable Wallaroo environment
2. Study the "Core Concepts" as our language specific documentation assumes familiarity.
3. Proceed to the documentation for the language that you will be using to write your Wallaroo application.
