# Setting Up Your Environment for Wallaroo

It is currently possible to develop Wallaroo applications on MacOS, Linux, or Windows. This guide currently has installation instructions for MacOS, Ubuntu Linux, and Windows 10 Pro via Bash/WSL. It's assumed if you are using a different Linux distribution that you are able to translate the Ubuntu instructions to your distribution of choice. Windows instructions are dependent on the usage of Bash/WSL. Follow the instructions for your operating system:

- [MacOS setup](macos-setup.md)
- [Ubunutu setup](linux-setup.md)
- [Windows setup](windows-setup.md)
