# Alphabet - Partitioned

Export the current directory as `PYTHONPATH`.

```
export PYTHONPATH=.
```

Set up a listener.

```
nc -l 127.0.0.1 7002 2>&1 | tee alphabet.out
```

Run `dianoga` with `--wallaroo-module alphabet_partitioned`.

```
build/dianoga -i 127.0.0.1:7010 -o 127.0.0.1:7002 -m 127.0.0.1:8000 \
-c 127.0.0.1:6000 -d 127.0.0.1:6001 -n worker-name --ponythreads=1 \ --wallaroo-module alphabet_partitioned
```

Send some messages

```
../../giles/sender/sender --buffy 127.0.0.1:7010 --file votes.msg \
--batch-size 5 --interval 100_000_000 --messages 150 --binary \
--variable-size --repeat --ponythreads=1
```

The messages have a 32-bit big-endian integer that represents the message length, followed by a byte that represents the character that is being voted on, followed by a 32-bit big-endian integer that represents the number of votes received for that letter.  The output is a byte representing the character that is being voted on, followed by the total number of votes for that character. You can view the output file with a tool like `hexdump`.
