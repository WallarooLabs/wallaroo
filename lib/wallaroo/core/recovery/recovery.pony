actor Recovery
  """
  Phases:
    1) _AwaitRecovering: Waiting for start_recovery() to be called
    2) _BoundariesReconnect: Wait for all boundaries to reconnect.
       It is possible to skip this phase if we are rolling back online because
       of a checkpoint abort.
    3) _PrepareRollback: Have EventLog tell all resilients to prepare for
    4) _RollbackLocalKeys: Roll back topology. Wait for acks from all workers.
       register downstream.
    5) _AwaitRollbackId: We request our rollback id from the
       CheckpointInitiator.
    6) _AwaitRecoveryInitiatedAcks: Wait for all workers to acknowledge
       recovery is about to start. This gives currently recovering workers a
       chance to cede control to us if we're the latest recovering.
    7) _RollbackBarrier: Use barrier to ensure that all old data is cleared
       and all producers and consumers are ready to rollback state.
    8) _AwaitDataReceiversAck: Put DataReceivers in non-recovery mode.
    9) _Rollback: Rollback all state to last safe checkpoint.
    10) _FinishedRecovering: Finished recovery
    11) _RecoveryOverrideAccepted: If recovery was handed off to another worker
