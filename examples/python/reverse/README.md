# Reverse

## About The Application

This is an example application that receives strings as input and outputs the reversed strings.

### Input

The inputs of the "Reverse" application are strings encoded in the [source message framing protocol](https://docs.wallaroolabs.com/book/appendix/tcp-decoders-and-encoders.html#framed-message-protocols#source-message-framing-protocol). Here's an example input message, written as a Python string:

```
"\x00\x00\x00\x05hello"
```

`\x00\x00\x00\x05` -- four bytes representing the number of bytes in the payload

`hello` -- the string `"hello"`

### Output

The outputs of the application are strings followed by newlines. Here's an example output message, written as a Python string:

`olleh\n` -- the string `"olleh"` (`"hello"` reversed)

### Processing

The `Decoders`'s `decode(...)` method creates a string from the value represented by the payload. The string is then sent to the `Reverse` computation where it is reversed. The reversed string is then sent to `Encode`'s `encode(...)` method, where a newline is appended to the string.

## Running Reverse

In order to run the application you will need Machida, Giles Sender, and the Cluster Shutdown tool. We provide instructions for building these tools yourself and we provide prebuilt binaries within a Docker container. Please visit our [setup](https://docs.wallaroolabs.com/book/getting-started/choosing-an-installation-option.html) instructions to choose one of these options if you have not already done so.

You will need three separate shells to run this application. Open each shell and go to the `examples/python/reverse` directory.

### Shell 1

Run `nc` to listen for the output messages:

```bash
nc -l 127.0.0.1 7002
```

### Shell 2

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `machida` executable. Set `PYTHONPATH` to refer to the current directory (where `reverse.py` is) and the `machida` directory (where `wallaroo.py` is). Assuming you installed Wallaroo according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` variables are pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
export PYTHONPATH="$PYTHONPATH:.:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida"
```

Run `machida` with `--application-module reverse`:

```bash
machida --application-module reverse --in 127.0.0.1:7010 --out 127.0.0.1:7002 \
  --metrics 127.0.0.1:5001 --control 127.0.0.1:6000 --data 127.0.0.1:6001 \
  --name worker-name --external 127.0.0.1:5050 --cluster-initializer \
  --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock
```

### Shell 3

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `sender`  executable. Assuming you installed Wallaroo according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` variable is pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
```

Send some messages:

```bash
sender --host 127.0.0.1:7010 --file words.txt \
  --batch-size 5 --interval 100_000_000 --messages 150 --repeat \
  --ponythreads=1 --ponynoblock --no-write
```

## Reading the Output

The output will be printed to the console in the first shell. Each line should be the reverse of a word found in the `words.txt` file.

## Shutdown

Set `PATH` to refer to the directory that contains the `cluster_shutdown` executable. Assuming you installed Wallaroo  according to the tutorial instructions you would do:

**Note:** If running in Docker, the `PATH` variable is pre-set for you to include the necessary directories to run this example.

```bash
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/machida/build:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/giles/sender:$HOME/wallaroo-tutorial/wallaroo/utils/cluster_shutdown"
```

You can shut down the cluster with this command at any time:

```bash
cluster_shutdown 127.0.0.1:5050
```

You can shut down Giles Sender by pressing `Ctrl-c` from its shell.
